## Introduction 

The idea of having R docker able to get external values when running is quite interesting.

As an example, suppose you have a docker that performs `x+1` and that you want to pass `x` to the docker when running it.

The easiest way consist of forcing `R` to read `x` from an environmental variable, say `X` and then pass `X` to the docker with the `--env` option.

## Docker File

Suppose you have a R docker build by the following dockerfile:

```
FROM rocker/r-ver:4.0.5

RUN mkdir /data
 
RUN mkdir /app
RUN chmod -R 755 /app

WORKDIR /app
ADD main.R .
CMD R -e  "source('main.R')"

```

## Main R script 

Where the  script `main.R` is:


```
x <- Sys.getenv("X")
y <- x+1
write(y, '/data/y.txt')
```

## Run 

After building the docker with:

```
docker build -t mydocker .
```

You can run it with 

```
sudo docker run --env X=99 --rm -v /data/:/data  mydocker
```

You should see the value of `y`, presumably 100, in the output file `y.txt`
