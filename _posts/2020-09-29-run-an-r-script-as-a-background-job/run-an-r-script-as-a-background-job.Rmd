title: "Run an R script as a background job"
description: |
  When working with R you may want to run a script that require quite a long time to complete. 
  As modern computers generally have more cores and ram than required this is not going to be a problem in terms of computer resources.
  Nevertheless, the script will take your R prompt busy preventing you from any other activity. 
  Function `rstudioapi::jobRunScript()` allows you avoid this problem.

##  Introduction 

When working with R you may want to run a script that require quite a long time to complete. 

As a basic non sense example consider:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
n <- 1200
y <- numeric(n)
for ( i in seq_len(n)){
  y[[i]] <- i 
  Sys.sleep(3)
}
sum(y)
```
<br>

This script, say `wait-for-me.R` when executed takes about one hour. 

If executed directly from the R console it will keep your R session busy for one hour preventing you to keep working on you current R session. 

In order to avoid this waste of time you can use three different approaches: 

1. R CMD BATCH 
2. RScript 
3. jobRunScript

## R CMD BATCH 

R CMD BATCH is a bash utility that allows you to run R in batch mode at the unix terminal

The usual command is:

```{shell , eval = FALSE}
R CMD BATCH infile.R outfile.log
```
<br>

`R` executes the instructions from `infile.R` and writes the output, both stdout and stderr, to `outfile.log`

When R terminates the execution of `infile.R` the working environment where the computation occurred is not saved. 
Therefore, if you want save any object, this should be done explicitly with instructions like `save()`, `save.image()`,`saveRDS()` or `readr::write_rds()`.
You can always import the files generated from these functions into your working session by using instructions like `load()`, `readRDS()`. `readr::read_rds()`.


## jobRunScript [@rstudioapi]

Function `jobRunScript()` from package `rstudioapi` is a newer and interesting alternative.

`jobRunScript()` is an R function from package `rstudioapi` and not a bash utility. As a result, you can run it at you R prompt within RStudio. `jobRunScript()` will execute your script in background and immediately return your R session available to you. Clearly, as `jobRunScript()` is part of or package `rstudioapi` it will not work outside RStudio




```{r,  eval = FALSE}
require(rstudioapi)
jobRunScript(path = './wait-for-me.R', 
             name = 'wait for me',
             encoding = "unknown", 
             workingDir = NULL,
             importEnv = FALSE, 
             exportEnv = "R_GlobalEnv")
```
<br>

This command tells R to run your script and export the objects created within this environment  

As stated by the function help:

* __path__: The path to the R script to be run.

* __name__: A name for the background job. When NULL (the default), the filename of the script is used as the job name.

* __encoding__: The text encoding of the script, if known.

* __workingDir__: The working directory in which to run the job. When NULL (the default), the parent directory of the R script is used.

* __importEnv__: Whether to import the global environment into the job.

* __exportEnv__: The name of the environment in which to export the R objects created by the job. Use "" (the default) to skip export, "R_GlobalEnv"' to export to the global environment, or the name of an environment object to create an object with that name.

Therefore, if you want to run a job a collect the results back in your working environmentyou need to set:  `exportEnv = "R_GlobalEnv"`

In case you need to pass any object from your global environmemnt to teh script you may want to use importEnv = TRUE. Personally, I woulkd not reccomend this choice. A script would be better to be seft contained and not to depend from objects defined elsewhere.
