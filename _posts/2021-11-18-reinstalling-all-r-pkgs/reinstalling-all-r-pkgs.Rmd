```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```



Assuming that ol packages have been installed in 

```
~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/
```

and that you want to install new packages in 

```
~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1/
```

Define installation directories

```
ld_loc <- "~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/"
new_loc <- "~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1/"
```

If new path does not exists, create it 

```
if ( !dir.exists(new_loc)) {dir.create(new_loc)}
```

Grab all old installed packages

```
pkgs <- installed.packages(lib.loc = old_loc)[, "Package"]
```

Install new packages in the location

```
install.packages(pkgs, 
                 lib = new_loc, 
                 ask = FALSE , 
                 repos =   'https://cran.wu.ac.at/',
                 dependencies = TRUE, 
                 Ncpus = 8)
```

Note that not all packages may install correctly but, the vast majority most of them will.
