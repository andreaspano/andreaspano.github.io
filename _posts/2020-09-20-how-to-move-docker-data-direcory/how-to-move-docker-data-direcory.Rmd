```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The default data directory used by docker system for storing images is `/var/lib/docker`. 
You may want to move this directory to another location on your system.

This goal can be achieved by following the next steps:


1. Stop the docker daemon

```{bash, eval = F}
sudo service docker stop`
```

2. Add a configuration file named daemon.json under the directory /etc/docker. The file should have this content:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
{ 
   "graph": "/path/to/your/docker" 
}
```


3. Copy the current data directory to the new one

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo rsync -aP /var/lib/docker/ /path/to/your/docker
```


4. Rename the old docker directory

```{bash , eval=FALSE}
sudo mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.old
```

5. Restart the docker daemon

```{bash , eval=FALSE }
sudo service docker start
```

6. Test

Create a new doocker and check that a new image appears in /path/to/your/docker

7. Cleanup

When you are sure that the new directory is being used correctly by docker daemon you can delete the old data directory.

```{bash , eval=FALSE}
sudo rm /var/lib/docker
```
