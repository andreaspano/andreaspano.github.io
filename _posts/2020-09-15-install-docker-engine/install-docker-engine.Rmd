```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Prerequisites 


Install Java

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install default-jre
```

Check your version of Java is Java 8


```{bash, eval = F}
java -version
```

you should see something like:

```{bash, eval = F}
openjdk version "11.0.8" 2020-07-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.8+10-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu120.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.8+10-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu120.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```


Update your system 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
```

Install dependencies 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

Add gpk key 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Verify it is installed

```{bash, eval = F }
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```

and it should return

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
pub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]
      9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
uid           [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
sub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]
```


Add docker repository 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

## Install docker 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

## Verify installation 

You can now test your docker engine with the basic `hello-world` container

```{bash, eval = F}
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Your system should take care of downloading the docker image from Docker Hub, build it and run it.
Output should look like:

```{bash, eval = F}
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:4cf9c47f86df71d48364001ede3a4fcd85ae80ce02ebad74156906caff5378bc
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

You can check the status of the docker service by

```{bash, eval = F}
sudo service docker status
```


Docker version is returned by:

```{bash, eval = F}
sudo docker version
```
